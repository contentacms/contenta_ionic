# Contenta CMS Ionic Demo

An example Ionic Framework demo using Contenta CMS as a backend.

This project also uses [contenta-angular-service](https://github.com/contentacms/contenta_angular_service),
This enables writing code at a high level and never making http calls directly.

It's highly recommended that you use this example application on a mobile
device, so that you get to see all the great native features Ionic provides!

# Building iOS/Android packages

Ionic Framework allows you to build packages fit for publishing on the App and
Google Play Store. Please read the [Ionic documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/build/)
for more details.

# Progressive web app (PWA) integration

This application includes the minimum headers required to be added to your
phone's home screen and behave as a native application. That said, service
workers, additional PWA tags, and offline support has not been added yet.
